:: diplomacy
You send envoys to foreign nations, seeking trade and aid. Some are skeptical of your legitimacy. 

One nation is willing to help—but in exchange, they demand control over a key district in the city. 

The council is divided. Accepting aid could restore order, but at the cost of sovereignty. 

What will you do? 

• [[Accept the deal and restore stability|accept_deal]]  
• [[Reject the offer and find another way|reject_deal]]  

:: accept_deal
The foreign power establishes an enclave in the city, bringing food and resources. 

The crisis is over—but you wonder if you've simply traded one ruler for another.

:: reject_deal
Without outside support, the city teeters on collapse. The revolutionaries gain strength. 

Soon, they march on the council chambers. The doors shatter. 

Your rule is over.
