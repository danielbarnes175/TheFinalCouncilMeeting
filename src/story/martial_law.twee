You order the military to take control of the streets. Curfews are imposed. Dissent is silenced. 

The people are afraid, but the riots stop. 

Some on the council warn that fear is not loyalty. 

Then, a new crisis arises. Rebel leaders send an ultimatum:  
**Relinquish control, or they will escalate.**

• [[Crush the rebellion completely|crush_rebellion]]  
• [[Offer limited freedoms|limited_freedoms]]

:: limited_freedoms
You ease restrictions, hoping to regain trust. Some welcome the gesture. Others see it as weakness. 

Tensions simmer beneath the surface. Stability is uncertain.
